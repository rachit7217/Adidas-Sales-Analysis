# Adidas-Sales-Analysis

To create a "**Adidas Sales Analysis**" project using **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**, the key features should focus on leveraging each tool to provide a comprehensive, insightful, and interactive sales dashboard. Below is a summary of essential features:

### **Data Collection (Excel & SQL):**
- **Data Import**: Excel will be used to gather sales data from various sources such as online sales platforms, retail store data, and regional performance reports. SQL 
   will enable importing data from relational databases to retrieve structured data like customer information, product inventory, and transactional details.
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Perform data cleaning to remove duplicates, null values, and errors. Transform raw data into a consistent format using SQL queries and 
   Excel functions. Normalizing data (e.g., date format, product categories) will be vital for accuracy.
  
### **Data Modeling (SQL & Power BI):**
- **Data Relationships**: Establish key relationships between datasets such as products, regions, salespersons, and time periods using SQL joins. This will enable multi- 
   dimensional analysis.
- **KPIs and Metrics**: Key metrics like total sales, average order value, region-wise sales, and profit margins will be calculated using SQL aggregates and Power BI 
   measures (DAX).

### **Visualization (Power BI):**
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Create a visually appealing Power BI dashboard with filters and slicers to view sales data by time period, region, and product category. Use 
    bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts for trends and comparisons.
- **Geo-Analysis**: Implement map visualizations to represent sales distribution across regions.
- **Trend Analysis**: Power BI will highlight sales trends, growth percentages, and seasonal performance to guide decision-making.

This setup ensures a powerful, data-driven overview of Adidas' sales performance.
